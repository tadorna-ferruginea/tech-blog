## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Content and languages

- Publish only paired Chinese and English content. Every item must have a matching file under
  `content/<type>/zh/` and `content/<type>/en/` with the same relative slug.
- Keep translated frontmatter and publish dates aligned. The language switcher must link each
  page to its exact counterpart, never to a generic home page.
- Every bilingual blog post must have one author-written original (Chinese or English); only
  its counterpart may be an AI translation. Add a disclosure immediately after the translated
  file's frontmatter, naming the exact model and the source language:
  `> 本文由 AI 模型 <模型名称> 从英文原文翻译；英文原文由 Nicole 手写，以英文原文为准。`
  for a Chinese translation, or
  `> This post was translated from Nicole's original Chinese by <model name>; the Chinese
  original prevails.` for an English translation.
- `archive/examples/` is intentionally outside the published content directories. Do not import
  it into content collections or edit it unless maintaining historical reference material.
- When adding a new route or UI label, provide both Chinese and English text.
